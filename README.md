[![Ask DeepWiki](https://devin.ai/assets/askdeepwiki.png)](https://deepwiki.com/jay-lchicken/helipopcorp)

KLC Code IDE is a full-featured, web-based Integrated Development Environment designed for educational purposes. Built with Next.js and leveraging the power of Monaco Editor, it provides a seamless coding experience for both students and teachers. The platform supports multiple programming languages, real-time code execution, and a role-based dashboard system for managing assignments.

## Features

-   **Role-Based User Management**: Secure authentication and authorization using Clerk, with distinct roles for 'students' and 'teachers'.
-   **Advanced Code Editor**: Powered by Monaco Editor (the editor that powers VS Code), offering syntax highlighting, theme selection, and a familiar coding environment.
-   **Multi-Language Support**: Execute code in a variety of popular languages, including JavaScript, Python, C++, Java, and more, via the Judge0 API.
-   **Integrated Terminal**: An in-browser terminal powered by Xterm.js displays real-time output, errors, and execution status.
-   **Teacher Dashboard**: An intuitive interface for teachers to create, view, and manage coding assignments for their students.
-   **Student Dashboard**: A centralized place for students to view their assigned tasks.
-   **Database Integration**: Persists user and assignment data using a PostgreSQL database.

## Environment Variables

To run this project locally, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables.

```env
# The public URL of your application
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Clerk Authentication Keys
# Get these from your Clerk dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

# PostgreSQL Database Connection String
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
```

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm, yarn, or pnpm
-   A running PostgreSQL database instance.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jay-lchicken/helipopcorp.git
    cd helipopcorp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the database:**
    Connect to your PostgreSQL instance and run the following SQL commands to create the necessary tables:

    ```sql
    -- Create the "users" table
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        clerkId VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );

    -- Create the "assignments" table
    CREATE TABLE assignments (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        level VARCHAR(100),
        subject VARCHAR(100),
        hash_userid_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        date_created TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and populate it with your keys and database connection string as described in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## API Endpoints

The application uses Next.js API Routes to handle backend logic.

-   `GET /api/usersync`: Synchronizes user data from Clerk to the local database upon login. It checks if a user exists and creates a new record if they don't.
-   `GET /api/GetAssignments`: Fetches assignments. Teachers can view all assignments, while students can only see their own.
-   `POST /api/NewAssignment`: Allows authenticated teachers to create and save a new assignment to the database.
-   `POST /api/SubmitAssignment`: Receives source code and a language ID, forwards it to the Judge0 API for execution, and returns the result (stdout or stderr).
-   `POST /api/clerk-webhook`: Handles the `user.created` event from Clerk Webhooks to automatically create user records in the database.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy this Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new).
